# SupportBot

SlackBot taht uses gtp-index to index the documentation, and than serves it based on /cldoc command

It needs:
- docs directory with all the docs files
- workdir directory where index will be stored
- credentials/access-tokens.json with openai_api_key, slack-app-token, slack-bot-token
